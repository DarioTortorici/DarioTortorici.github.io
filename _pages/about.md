Welcome to my site. This more than a portfolio is intended to keep some order of projects done, in progress and that I would like to develop. Do not have complete faith in the updating of information here. Today that I write, I want to fix it, tomorrow who knows.
If you are here it means that you might be interested in:

# The real "about me"
I usually don't share personal stories online ([this is why](https://dariotortorici.github.io/posts/2024/04/personal-branding/)), but let me tell you a bit about myself. I was born in 2001 in Palermo. After getting my IT diploma in 2020, I moved to Trento to pursue my Computer Science degree. In 2023 I graduated and I'm still in Trento for a master's degree in Artificial Intelligence Systems. That's it.
