This is a seminar paper for the course "Artificial and Biological Neural Systems". The paper is a critical review of the current state of the art of text-to-image models and the information we have so far about the same process in the brain. I also wanted to state whether the machine can be described as creative with this comparison.

# Abstract
Creativity has been a subject of interest for philosophers, psychologists and neuroscientists.
It is a fundamental human characteristic that facilitates problem-solving. This discussion has
been further expanded with the growing interest in generative models in artificial intelligence,
particularly in the field of text-to-image generation. This paper provides a comparative analysis
of the creative processes of human artists and AI-driven models, with a specific focus on the
cognitive mechanisms and neural substrates that underpin visual creativity. The study explores
the definition and measurement of creativity, acknowledging its multifaceted nature. The research
explores the cognitive aspects of creativity, including memory and the creative process, to gain
insight into the interplay of conscious and unconscious mental processes in creative ideation. The
aim is to compare state-of-the-art AI architectures with human creative endeavors to identify
similarities and differences between the two systems. The study emphasises the collaborative
nature of creative expression and highlights the symbiotic relationship between human input
and machine output in the realm of text-to-image generation. This study aims to contribute to
the ongoing dialogue surrounding the nature of creativity and its manifestation across different
modalities.
