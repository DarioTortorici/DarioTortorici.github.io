I apologize this is in italian.
This is an essay for the "Information systems" course. It aims to highlight the importance of cybersecurity for small and medium-sized enterprises. These enterprises often believe that their size makes them less vulnerable to cyber attacks. However, they are often more susceptible because they lack the necessary protection. In this context, artificial intelligence can be a valuable tool for the improvement of their security. It is a cost-effective and automated solution that can be easily implemented.
