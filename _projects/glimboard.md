# What is Glimboard
GlimBoard is a platform for creative training and development. Currently it offers a mini-game where you have to list some ideas to solve the daily challenge. Here's the [website](https://glimboard.com)

# Why the project
I want to build a dynamic and collaborative creative ecosystem that allows creatives to explore, learn and connect. If want to help me develop it, contact me. My Glimboard email address is `dario.tortorici@glimboard.com`.
