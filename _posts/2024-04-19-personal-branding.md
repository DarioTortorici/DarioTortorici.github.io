### Welcome with a provocation

---

As I begin this blog, I find myself in a somewhat paradoxical situation. I want to talk about personal branding, a concept about which I have some reservations. 
Personal branding is about creating and promoting your public image. It's about defining who you are, what you stand for, and how you want to be perceived. While seemingly innocuous, I remain sceptical about the culture into which individuals project themselves as brands. You're creating a brand image, deciding what to do and what not to do, even when you're not selling anything, making you a commodity. I recognise the potential benefits of personal branding, particularly in terms of career advancement and self-marketing. However, my discomfort stems from the superficiality that is often woven into it, where authenticity takes a back seat to constructed images and narratives. Even when there's not a selection to what show i feel that the world of media exposure is used to show what I pretend to be in order to suppress my anxieties about really knowing myself.
Criticism of personal branding already exists, and conversations about authenticity and the commodification of identity have been well explored, so I won't elaborate further. I'm just an ordinary guy and this opinion will not be read by anyone, as it should be. And if you do read it, i should have a clear conscience on how I got you to read it. Promote yourself out of venting, not out of attention-seeking. Otherwise you will feel the pain of disrespecting your intimacy.
The purpose of this blog is just that, to talk about what I think is important to understand my perception of the world, and thus to understand myself. So, important concept of this article, I am a hypocrite 🐧.
