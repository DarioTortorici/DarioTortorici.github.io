Public AI Challenge by Hub Innovation Trentino (HIT) 2022 - Anomaly Detection with LSTM
MeteoTrentino is a structure of the Autonomous Province of Trento founded in 1997. It counts
more than 100 hundred weather stations all over the Trentino region.
The challenge proposed by MeteoTrentino is to use Artificial Intelligence to make up a code able to effectively detect anomalies in the real-time data and be integrated in the protocol to generate the
alerts, thus supporting the operator in charge of data quality control in his work.
As part of a group consisting of four individuals with backgrounds in engineering and physics, we developed an LSTM model. The model can be found [here](https://github.com/eliazonta/AI-Challenge-HIT-2022)
