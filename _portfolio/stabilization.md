Academic Project (2023) - Stabilization algorithm

This is an academic project for the Signal,Image and video course. The project is intended to mimic the process used in the paper:"[Ravankar, A., Rawankar, A. & Ravankar, A.A. Video stabilization algorithm for field robots in uneven terrain. Artif Life Robotics 28, 502â€“508 (2023).](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10015-023-00883-x)"

This is the [code](https://dariotortorici.github.io/files/Video_stabilization_project.ipynb) and this is my [essay](https://dariotortorici.github.io/files/stabilization-essay.pdf). If you're just interested in the result, here's an [example](https://dariotortorici.github.io/files/stabilization.avi)
