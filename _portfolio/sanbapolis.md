This thesis focused on the development of a web platform aimed at simplifying the management of training session recordings in the sports arena, with the aim of creating a technological infrastructure that could facilitate the companies involved.
The internship was part of the inter-departmental project for the modernization of sports facilities technologies. As Italy had been designated for the Winter Olympic Games (Milan-Cortina 2026) and there were disciplines to be held in Trentino, this was the perfect opportunity to equip these facilities which were still under construction.
In this context, the Sanbapolis project was a test case for addressing and understanding the infrastructure challenges associated with this digital revolution in sport.
